    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Affalterbach.  This combination is just irresistible and is limited to 750 units: Mercedes-AMG is combining its top model brimming with motorsport technology with the freedom of the open-air driving experience – crowning the model portfolio of open-top sports cars. The new AMG GT R Roadster (combined fuel consumption: 12.4 l/100 km; combined CO2 emissions: 284 g/km[1]) is just as much at home on winding racetracks as it is on prestigious boulevards or beautiful coastal roads. With its powerful drive and expressive design it addresses a new, lifestyle-oriented target group which lives life to the full. The 430 kW/585 hp V8 biturbo, the adjustable coil-over suspension with active rear axle steering, the active aerodynamics and the intelligent lightweight construction form the foundations for highly dynamic handling characteristics. And like the other roadster models the open AMG GT R also has the triple-layer fabric soft top with a lightweight structure consisting of aluminium, magnesium and steel.

        With this latest addition the AMG GT family now has 16 members: five two-door coupés, four roadsters, two customer sports racing cars and five 4-door coupés. "The new AMG GT R Roadster is far more than the combination of the thrilling vehicle dynamics of the GT R with the special flair of our GT Roadsters. It is the essence of two worlds, blending to deliver our brand pledge, Driving Performance, in a very special way. With our GT R Roadster we have without doubt once again developed a brand-defining sports car. It too embodies
        Mercedes-AMG in form, function and vehicle dynamics and enriches our GT family with a highly exclusive variant limited to 750 units", says Tobias Moers, Chairman of the Management Board of Mercedes-AMG GmbH.
        
        The AMG 4.0-litre V8 biturbo in the AMG GT R Roadster delivers an output of 430 kW (585 hp) and maximum torque of 700 Nm. This is available over a wide engine speed range from 2100 to 5500 rpm. The eight-cylinder power unit delivers muscular performance in all engine speed ranges, combined with high efficiency. A sprint from standstill to 100 km/h is absolved in 3.6 seconds. The dynamic power delivery continues right up to the top speed of 317 km/h.</p>
